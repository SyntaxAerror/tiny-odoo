Per the LGPLv3 that Odoo Community Edition is licensed under, modifications will "carry prominent notices" of the modification and "a relevant date" for that modification.  
These notices will usually take the form of a comment near the top of the file that inclues who made the modification, when the modification was made, and a brief description of what was modified. When such a comment is impractical or impossible, the notice will be contained in its own dedicated `COPYRIGHT` file (or `COPYRIGHT.additional` file as applicable) in (or as close as possible to) the same directory.  
These modifications are covered by the LGPLv3, per section 5c of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPLv3) included in the LGPLv3 (`/LICENSE.odoo`).

Files from Odoo Community Edition such as `LICENSE`, `COPYRIGHT`, `README.md`, and `SECURITY.md` have been renamed to have the `.odoo` filename extension to specify that they cover Odoo Community Edition, and are not the overarching `LICENSE`, `COPYRIGHT`, `README.md`, etc. of this project.  
Files from Odoo Community Edition will sometimes contain a section with a statement like:  
> "Part of Odoo. See LICENSE file for full copyright and licensing details."

As the original Odoo Community Edition The LICENSE and COPYRIGHT files have been renamed for clarity,
please refer to `/LICENSE.odoo` and `/COPYRIGHT.odoo` for full upstream license and notices.
